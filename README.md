As for storing the API key, I know that this is not the correct solution. The key is publicly accessible, but I decided to do this only because the application is a recruitment project.

The project has tested all the relevant service classes. Normally I would try to write this code in MVVM, using SwiftUI. And I would have nested the views themselves written in SwiftUI in HotingViewControllers.
Here, the low target of the app (ios 13 - SwiftUI was very limited at the time) did not allow for this, and it would have allowed for free testing of ViewModels.
